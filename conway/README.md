http://codingdojo.org/kata/GameOfLife/

- Classic Conway's game of life. Made during Code Retreat (Mallorca 2018).
- Implemented in haskell (backend part) and Javascript (frontend).
- Use of websockets to update canvas.
- Made using TDD style.

If you want to try it, you'll need to generate the javascript for index.html first. In order to do so, you need npm installed in your machine and run:

- npm run-script build

Start the server using:

- runhaskell Server.hs

in app folder.

Once you've done it, just open index.html in your favourite browser and enjoy.
