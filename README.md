# Katas

In this section I'm going to try to upload some of the katas that the Mallorca Software Craftsmanship is doing.

I usually use Java/Javascript on a daily basis so I'll try to make use of other languages in which I'm less fluent but I certainly like, such as Haskell or Scheme. Most than probable, some katas will be done in Java as well as Haskell/Scheme.

Curently done Katas:

 1. WordWrap (Haskell)
 2. Bowling (Haskell)
 3. Diamond (Haskell)
 4. Greeting (Haskell)
 5. Shopping cart (Kotlin) - my first Kotlin application
 6. Vending machine (Python) - my first Python application
 7. Alphaber-Cipher (Scala) - my first Scala application
 8. Weather-kata (Java) - Codium team from Barcelona introduced us to this Kata which main purpose was dealing with legacy code

 Not Katas but just for fun and using TDD

 1. Eight Queens (Haskell)
